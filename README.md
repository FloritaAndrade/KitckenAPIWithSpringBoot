Building a Kitchen module with Spring Boot and rest API to enable below functions:

1. The kitchen will have an inventory of ingredients
2. It will also have recipes with instructions and required ingredients for the recipe.

Given that there are enough ingredients, it can make the delicious recipes, and by doing so consume ingredients.
If you are running out of ingredients, there is of course an endpoint for delivering new ingredients!
